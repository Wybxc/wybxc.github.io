= About the Site

Welcome to my digital garden. This space functions as both a personal blog and an academic portfolio, curating my thoughts, experiences, and ongoing projects.

The site is built with #link("https://typst.app/")[Typst], a remarkably simple yet elegant typesetting system#footnote[I find Markdown too limited for typesetting and LaTeX too cumbersome to tweak. Typst offers the perfect middle ground.], and #link("https://astro.build/")[Astro], a powerful and flexible static site generator.

The aesthetic is a homage to #link("https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/")[Edward Tufte]’s design philosophy, characterized by the distinctive use of sidenotes. That said, I do not strictly adhere to every rule; I have taken the liberty to customize elements, such as the #link("https://ctan.org/pkg/mlmodern")[MLModern] font, to suit my own taste.

This site is a living project. I hope you enjoy exploring these pages as much as I enjoyed building them. Happy reading!

The source code is available on #link("https://github.com/Wybxc/wybxc.github.io")[GitHub]#footnote[It might look a bit unstructured, as I had to use some creative hacks to play with Typst's experimental HTML export feature.].
